## 📚 Project Description
- In an era dominated by digital streaming platforms such as Spotify and YouTube, users worldwide face a common frustration - intrusive interruptions in their music or podcast streams caused by irrelevant advertisements.

- Our solution involves leveraging deep audio embedding technology coupled with advanced anomaly detection/classification techniques to seamlessly remove disruptive advertisements from audio streams in near real-time. Our aim is to encapsulate this solution within a user-friendly platform.

- Project components: Audio embeddings extraction, Ad detection
- Methods: ML model for classification (SVM, Random Forest) and anomaly detection (KNN, Isolation Forest)

## ⚡ Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### 🧱 Prerequisites
Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Example 1](https://www.example.com)
- [Example 2](https://www.example.com)

### 🏗️ Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## 🧪 Testing
Explain how to run tests for this project

### Sample Tests
Explain what these tests test and why

    Give an example

## 🚀 Deployment
Add additional notes on how to deploy this on a live system
